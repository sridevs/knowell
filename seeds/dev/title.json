Is Nick Allen a troublemaker? He really just likes to liven things up at school -- and he's always had plenty of great ideas. When Nick learns some interesting information about how words are created, suddenly he's got the inspiration for his best plan ever...the frindle. Who says a pen has to be called a pen? Why not call it a frindle? Things begin innocently enough as Nick gets his friends to use the new word. Then other people in town start saying frindle. Soon the school is in an uproar, and Nick has become a local hero. His teacher wants Nick to put an end to all this nonsense, but the funny thing is frindle doesn't belong to Nick anymore. The new word is spreading across the country, and there's nothing Nick can do to stop it."

Claims that the tournament served to revive the one-day international format aren't far off the mark. It had close, engaging matches, a reasonable balance between bat and ball (and this in a World Cup that was written off as a series of run-fests in the offing before it began) and kept a subcontinent in thrall for its duration. The favourites weren't overwhelmingly favoured, unlike in previous years, and though they did make it to the title, they didn't coast to it. The torunament also provided the cherry on the career cake of possibly the best-loved cricketer of all time. This book attempts to recapture the magic of the tenth eition of cricket's premier event."

Statistics in a Nutshell is a clear and concise introduction and reference that's perfect for anyone with no previous background in the subject. This book gives you a solid understanding of statistics without being too simple, yet without the numbing complexity of most college texts. You get a firm grasp of the fundamentals and a hands-on understanding of how to apply them before moving on to the more advanced material that follows. Each chapter presents you with easy-to-follow descriptions illustrated by graphics, formulas, and plenty of solved examples. Before you know it, you'll learn to apply statistical reasoning and statistical techniques, from basic concepts of probability and hypothesis testing to multivariate analysis. Organized into four distinct sections, Statistics in a Nutshell offers you: Introductory material: Different ways to think about statistics Basic concepts of measurement and probability theory Data management for statistical analysis Research design and experimental design How to critique statistics presented by others Basic inferential statistics: Basic concepts of inferential statistics The concept of correlation, when it is and is not an appropriate measure of association Dichotomous and categorical data The distinction between parametric and nonparametric statistics Advanced inferential techniques: The General Linear Model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and MANOVA Multiple linear regression Specialized techniques: Business and quality improvement statistics Medical and public health statistics Educational and psychological statistics Unlike many introductory books on the subject, Statistics in a Nutshell doesn't omit important material in an effort to dumb it down. And this book is far more practical than most college texts, which tend to over-emphasize calculation without teaching you when and how to apply different statistical tests. With Statistics in a Nutshell, you learn how to perform most common statistical analyses, and understand statistical techniques presented in research articles. If you need to know how to use a wide range of statistical techniques without getting in over your head, this is the book you want."

    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must."

Now, instructors can easily choose whether they would like to teach a course which emphasizes database application development or a course that emphasizes database systems issues. New overview chapters at the beginning of parts make it possible to skip other chapters in the part if you don't want the detail. More applications and examples have been added throughout the book, including SQL and Oracle examples. The applied flavor is further enhanced by the two new database applications chapters."

    "description": "Swami is ten years old, and life for him consists mainly of having adventures with his friends, avoiding the misery of homework, and coping as best as he can with the teachers and other adults he encounters. His greatest passion is the M CC - the Malgudi Cricket Club - which he founds together with his friends: his greatest day is when the examinations are over and school breaks up - a time for revelry and cheerful ritousness. But the innocent and impulsive Swami lands in trouble when he is carried away by the more serious unrest of India in 1930. Somehow he gets himself expelled from two schools in succession, and when things have gone quite out of hand he is forced to run away from home ... This is far more than a simple narrative of Swami's adventures - charming and entertaining as they are. By the delicate sympathetically observed, the author establishes for us the child's world as the child himself sees it: and beyond, the adult community he will one day belong to - in Swami's case, the town of Malgudi, which provides the setting of almost all Narayan's later novels."

Fourteen-year-old Mati and her twelve-year-old brother, Satya, are secretly spirited away by the loyal Jaya Prabhasa, the most accomplished warrior in the land. As they journey through a world they have never known in all their sheltered existence, and are put to the test by an eccentric flying sadhu, Mati and Satya acquire some extraordinary skills to survive mysterious forests and perilous swamps. But are these sufficient to help the three companions evade marauding armies and rescue their parents? This adventure fantasy set in ancient India, long before the region acquired the name, is written in the engaging style of a historical thriller. Its heroes must discover how to deal with injustice without descending to the level of their violent persecutors. Through contemplative poetic incantation and robust uncluttered prose, it also weaves into its fabric issues such as the status of women and care for the environment."

It is based on an episode in the Mahabharata, where Yayati, one of the ancestors of the Pandavas, is given the curse of premature old age by his father-in-law, Shukracharya, who is incensed by Yayati's infidelity. Yayati could redeem this curse only if someone was willing to exchange his youth with him. It is his son, Pooru, who finally offers to do this for his father. The play examines the moment of crisis that Pooru's decision sparks, and the dilemma it presents for Yayati, Pooru, and Pooru's young wife."

Narayan’s enchanting novels’—The New Yorker Raju, a corrupt tourist guide, together with his lover, the dancer Rosie, leads a prosperous life before he is thrown into prison. After release he rests on the steps of an abandoned temple when a peasant passing by mistakes him for a holy man. Slowly, almost reluctantly, he begins to play the part, acting as a spiritual guide to the village community. Raju’s holiness is put to the test when a drought strikes the village, and he is asked to fast for twelve days to summon the rains. Set in Narayan’s fictional town, Malgudi, The Guide is the greatest of his comedies of self-deception. ‘A brilliant accomplishment … Narayan is the compassionate man who can write of human life as comedy’—The New York Times Book Review ‘Narayan is such a natural writer, so true to his experience and emotions’—V.S. Naipaul"

Vishnu is more a love-inspiring than a fear-inspiring deity. The Tales of Vishnu are adapted from the Bhagawat Purana, which abounds in narratives of Vishnu s benevolent acts. He is kind and sympathetic but is never influenced by the apparent devotion of evil men. Even when they succeed in wrestling favours from other gods, Vishnu manoeuvres to destroy them without falsifying the boons given to them by the gods."

Peace is made possible by the establishment of a powerful force at the centre, whose suzerainty is acknowledged by neighbouring vassal states. With peace comes progress and the development of the arts. The most significant power ever to rule for any length of time in central India was the Rashtrakoota dynasty, which held its sway for 200 years, from the eighth to the tenth century.This account narrates the beginning of the glorious Rashtrakoota Empire, and the sculpting of the unique and exquisite Kailasanath Temple, an outstanding tribute to Lord Shiva. Carved out of a single rock under the patronage of Emperor Krishna of Ellichpur, this temple in Ellora has withstood the ravages of time and history. Today, it continues to bear testimony to the splendid reign of the Rashtrakootas."

    "description": "Rabindranath Tagore played a significant role in bringing about a new awakening in India in the latter half of the nineteenth century. His life and creative work provided the then Indian society with a purpose, direction and a programme. The impact of his personality transcended his native Bengal and came to be felt not only in other parts of India but also abroad. Tagore was a genius with a many-sided personality. He was a poet, novelist, dramatist, musician, short-story writer, teacher, painter, educationist, philosopher and humanist. Shri Khanolkar, his biographer, describes his life as 'a long dream of colour and music, of beauty and heavenly genius, such as this world has never known before'. Perhaps no other contemporary Indian had such diverse interests as Tagore had. He was a seeker. He wanted to understand himself; and that he could only do by expressing himself. As the experiences and emotions differed, the media also varied. That is how we have Tagore the poet, Tagore the composer, Tagore the painter and so on. Although a staunch nationalist, Tagore was a champion of internationalism, touring various countries and pleading for 'one world'. He has the unique distinction of being the only poet to have two of his songs - Jana Gana Mana and Amar Sonar Bangla - adopted as the national anthem of two countries, India and Bangladesh respectively. Shanti-Niketan stands to this day as a living monument to the Gurudev. He composed over 4,000 songs. His compositions have come to be known as Rabindra Sangeet."

A free India was his heaven and the martyrs of the freedom struggle were his gods. Using disguise and guile, persuasion and force, his life was a roller-coaster ride through an unjust system. But eventually, he awakened India and the world to the idea of liberty and brought the mighty British Raj to its knees."

    "description": "Panchatantra (Five Chapters) in Sanskrit is perhaps the oldest collection of stories in the world and has been translated into more than 50 languages. Each of its 'Chapters' contains a string of stories one emerging from the other, with each designed to lead to a precept for proper practical conduct for a thinking person in the real world. The characters are taken from the whole gamut of living beings including humans and animals in the wild. In a way the unity of life is stressed by assigning the sentiments, emotions and thoughts of human beings to animals as well. The stories here bring out how: scholarship without commonsense can lead to disaster; action imitated thoughtlessly does not yield the desired fruit; hasty acts based on suspicion will make you repent; greed may bring unwanted acquisitions; one life-saving skill is preferable to a thousand clever tricks; it is wise not to allow imagination run wild. These stories are based on a Kannada translation of the Panchatantra."

When he was asked why he was riding the donkey backwards, he replied: \"I'm leading these boys to school and they're a mischievous lot! This way I can keep an eye on them on the way!\" \"Then why not ask them to walk in front of you?\" asked a man. \"Don't be absurd!\", scolded Naseeruddin, \"I'm their leader. How can a leader follow his followers?\" The stories in this book are taken from Tinkle archives and have all appeared in Tinkle magazine at some time or the other."

    "description": "In this profound and playful book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb presents his ideas about life in the form of aphorisms, the world’s earliest - and most memorable - literary form. Procrustes was a character from Greek mythology who abducted travellers and invited them to spend the night in a special bed, which they had to fit to perfection. They never did. Those who were too tall had their legs chopped off; those who were too short were stretched. Every aphorism here is about a Procrustean bed of sorts – we humans, facing the limits of our knowledge, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies and pre-packaged narratives. Only by embracing the unexpected – and accepting what we don’t know – can we see the world as it really is."

    "description": "Why are some people easily outsourced, downsized, or freelanced into obscurity, while others have their pick of opportunities? In his most powerful book yet, Seth Godin argues that it's more essential than ever to become indispensable - to become a linchpin. Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations: they invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They love their work and pour their best selves into it and turn each day into a kind of art - and, in today's world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom. Godin shows that the key to being indispensable is overcoming the fears that hold most of us back. If you have you ever found a shortcut that others missed, seen a new way to resolve a conflict, or made a connection with someone others couldn't reach, then you have what it takes to become indispensable. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map."

Levitt, Black Swan author Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Nudge co-author Richard Thaler, Thinking Fast and Slow offers a whole new look at the way our minds work, and how we make decisions.Why is there more chance we'll believe something if it's in a bold type face? Why are judges more likely to deny parole before lunch? Why do we assume a good-looking person will be more competent? The answer lies in the two ways we make choices: fast, intuitive thinking, and slow, rational thinking. This book reveals how our minds are tripped up by error and prejudice (even when we think we are being logical), and gives you practical techniques for slower, smarter thinking. It will enable to you make better decisions at work, at home, and in everything you do."

    "description": "From the author of international bestseller The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Fooled by Randomness is the bestselling account of the hidden role of chance in life and the markets.Everyone wants to succeed in life. But what causes some of us to be more successful than others? Is it really down to skill and strategy - or something altogether more unpredictable? This book is the word-of-mouth sensation that will change the way you think about business and the world. It is all about luck: more precisely, how we perceive luck in our personal and professional experiences. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the markets - we hear an entrepreneur has 'vision' or a trader is 'talented', but all too often their performance is down to chance rather than skill. It is only because we fail to understand probability that we continue to believe events are non-random, finding reasons where none exist. A Financial Times book of the year, this irreverent bestseller has shattered the illusions of people around the world by teaching them how to recognize randomness. Now it can do the same for you. 'One of the smartest books of all time' Fortune 'An iconoclastic tour de force ... nothing escapes his Exocets' Evening Standard 'Brilliant' John Kay 'Excellent and thought-provoking ... an entertaining book' Financial Times 'Wall Street's principal dissident' Malcolm Gladwell Nassim Nicholas Taleb (b.1960) has devoted his life to immersing himself in probelmce s of luck, uncertainty , probability and knowledge. His books The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness have been published in thirty-one languages and Fooled by Randomness was selected by Fortune magazine as one of 'The Smartest Books of All Time'."
